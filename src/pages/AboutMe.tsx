          </h1>
          <h4>WHO AM I?</h4>
          <p>
            Hello! I’m Justyna, a Front-End Developer with a background in
            Journalism and a passion for creating beautiful, functional web
            experiences. My journey began with a Bachelor's degree in
            Journalism, where I honed my storytelling skills. Driven by a desire
            to craft engaging digital experiences, I completed an intensive
            course in front-end development.
          </p>
          <h4>EXPERIENCE</h4>
          <p>
            Though my professional experience includes roles in the medical and
            hospitality sectors, these diverse roles have sharpened my
            problem-solving abilities and attention to detail. I’m excited to
            apply these skills to the tech world, where I specialize in HTML,
            CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and React.
          </p>
          <h4>INTERESTS</h4>
          <p>
            Beyond coding, I’m deeply interested in UX/UI design and committed
            to creating not only visually appealing but also highly functional
            and user-centric websites and applications. Outside of tech, you’ll
            find me practicing yoga and Pilates, exploring Slavic mythology,
            embarking on new adventures, and continually learning about the
            latest technologies.
          </p>
          <h4>RESUME</h4>
